## About the Book
This practical guide, "Smart Home Automation with IoT" shows you how to create a smart home without breaking the bank. Instead of relying on expensive, closed systems, you utilize the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) with open-source software to design a custom smart home experience that perfectly suits your needs.

This book teaches you to create smart home IoT solutions using Raspberry Pi and microcontrollers like Arduino, NodeMCU (ESP8266), and ESP32. You will learn to program these microcontrollers, control relay modules, and use sensors for data collection. The guide covers using OpenHAB, InfluxDB, Mosquitto MQTT Broker, and Grafana with Raspberry Pi, enabling a unified system without coding. It also shows how to connect OpenHAB to Alexa or Google Home for voice commands and automate tasks like lighting. Bonus content includes using Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, AI-based hand gesture and face detection, and Docker containers.

By the end of this book, you will be a confident smart home builder, equipped with the knowledge and skills to design, implement, and manage a customized system using open-source software.
